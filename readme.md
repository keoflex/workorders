# Form Flow

A simple way for large groups to organize work using forms!

## Current Features

* Define custom forms for users to submit. aka: work orders.
* Custom approval routing. Define multiple levels of approval routing.
* Email notifications. Submitters and approvers receive email updates.
* Ability to approve or deny work at each level.
* Approver commenting. Quickly see history for each form.
* Last person on the approver list completes the flow and work is marked as complete.
